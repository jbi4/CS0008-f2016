Description: Third Assignment

My thought process for this assignment was to go through and read both files. Then to create lists of the information
and iterate through to see the distances run and by who.

I do not want to make excuses and I accept the grade I am given. I was traveling and had a funeral the past few days and
also had limited internet access. I was unable to get straight counting the names and acheiving the names from the min
and max.
