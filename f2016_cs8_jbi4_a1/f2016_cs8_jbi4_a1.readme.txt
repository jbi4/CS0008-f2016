For this program, I tried to figure out the simplest way to write my code to limit my confusion. I started off leaving a
spot for me to set all my variables to 0. Then I got my first input by asking the user to decide which unit of measure
they would like to use. I put that they should say USC or Metric. I then used an if-else-if statement to get inputs for
distance driven and gas usage for metrics and then for USC. I also converted the two inputs to the other unit of
measure in the statement so that all four of those variables, distance driven and gas usage for each, were set. I also
have a check for invalid inputs and print an error message to show the user if they needed to change the inputs. I used
else at the end to print an error for any invalid input into the unit of measure prompt. I then solved for the fuel
consumption by checking to make sure the inputs were all greater than 0. If they were I solved for the fuel consumption
of both units of measure, and if they were not, I set all the variables to zero. Doing that would print an error under
the gas consumption rating. This was my next step as I used if-else-if to calculate the gas consumption rating from the
fuel consumption I had just calculated. The error occurs if invalid inputs were put into either the distance driven or
gas usage amounts. My final step was to format the numbers and print the output like the chart on the assignment. I used
the tab function and the format function along with my variables to set up the output.
