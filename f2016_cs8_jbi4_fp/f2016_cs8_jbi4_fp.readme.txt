Description: Final Project

My thought process for this assignment was to go through my assignment three. I initially missed using a dictionary and
when Alex helped us in class with this I modified my assignment to use a dictionary. For the class part of this
assignment, I defined a class and added the name, runs, and distance as the initial categories. I then followed the
prompt to create the other class abilities.



As a side note, I just wanted to say thank you again. I am a senior business student, who just took this class to get
some general programming knowledge, more about the methods and ways of thinking rather than specifically python. I
appreciate all of your help and teaching. I really think I learned a lot so thank you!
