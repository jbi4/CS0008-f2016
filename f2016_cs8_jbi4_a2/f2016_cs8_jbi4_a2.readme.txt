Description: Second Assignment

The process for this assignment was to start by defining the two functions, one to process each individual file and one
to print the outcome. In processing the file, I split the terms to be able to accumulate distance and also added a
counter to count the lines. The printkv is used to print different formats for different types of characters.
The body starts with initializing the total distance and total line variables. Next, I needed to get an input for the
file to be opened. After we can run process file and return the outcomes. I loop this process to run the totals and then
close the file and ask for the next one still in the loop. The last thought is to print the totals.
